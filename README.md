# Video Streaming Services Data Analysis
First DA Capstone Project for GC. Team: Ava Niakouei, Brendan Cervone, Khalil Amin

Plan:
- EDA together to get an idea of the data's story and achieve domain knowledge as a group.
- Decide on the main questions we are exploring in each data set:
- Which streaming service has the newest content?
    -histogram for release year
    -distribution hist for release year
- Which genre would be the best investment for future content?
    -genre per release year
    - distinct count for genre one on Net vs distinct count for genre for Hulu, disney, prime
- Which streaming service is most likely to buy a R rated movie?
    -rating histogram
    -which streaming services have more kids friendly options? (g rating vs count)
    -rating vs type
- Which product would be better to invest in, a tv show or a movie?
    -count for different types across streaming services
    -proportional graph of total for movies vs TV

    - Presentation Plan:
    - Focus on analytical results but sprinkle in technical steps, if unique steps taken/demonstrate proficiency
    - Define the intended stakeholders: Hiring manager, consumers (consumer profile: American Family, child ranges 3 - 17 yo, parents love old movies)
