Plan:
- EDA together to get an idea of the data's story and achieve domain knowledge as a group.
- Decide on the main questions we are exploring in each data set:
- Which streaming service has the newest content?
- Which streaming service has the widest range of content in terms of Release Year?
- What streaming service is geared towards which age group?
- Which streaming service has the most diverse content offering based on genre?
