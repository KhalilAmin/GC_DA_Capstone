# Video Streaming Services Data Analysis
First DA Capstone Project for GC. Team: Ava Niakouei, Brendan Cervone, Khalil Amin

Plan:
- EDA together to get an idea of the data's story and achieve domain knowledge as a group.
- Decide on the main questions we are exploring in each data set:
- Which streaming service has the newest content?
    -histogram for release year
    -distribution hist for release year
- Which streaming service has the widest range of genre?
    -genre per release year
    - distinct count for genre one on Net vs distinct count for genre for Hulu, disney, prime
- What streaming service is geared towards which age group?
    -rating histogram
    -which streaming services have more kids friendly options? (g rating vs count)
    -rating vs type
- What streaming service is the best for movie lovers?
    - What streaming services have the most diverse options(tv shows/movies)? 
    -count for different types across streaming services
    -proportional graph of total for movies vs TV
